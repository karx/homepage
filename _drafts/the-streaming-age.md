I would start to describing and talking about our Streaming age by talking little about how things used to be. The advent of Films/Videography is not new, it happened in the 20th century. We had Video tapas, disk recording, and later, streaming media.

This evolution has also brought about a considerable change in how the Viewing experience has evolved. In this article, I would focus more on these evolution of the viewing experience and how it affects the ecology.

Theaters. Theaters where the place where one used to go to view a Films/Videos or a Performance. It was a skillful and heavy job to be able to replay media from a recording or setup a stage for an act. Large groups of people gathered to enjoy this playback. Even when TVs came out, families used to gather together to watch Films and TV series to enjoy. Watching a Media stream was a `Communal Experience`.

Then came the smartphones and the tablets, the cheaper PCs, viewing habits became personal. After the Youtube Boom, the viewing experience became very personal. The viewing sessions were private, even when we share, its for private viewing later. The sitting together and watching, felt quite diminished.

## The Canvas

Streaming, to a broadcasting service, has become the new Canvas. 

The canvas everyone wants to use! 

The interaction possible on this medium is only second to talking one-on-one. The community aspects of it opens door for new experiences. It never so accessible to have a stable channel of interaction with so many people involved. 

### If this is streaming age, what was the last Age ?

Streaming Age   
\- Information Age   
\-- Globalization  
\--- The Great Divergence  
\----- Colonial/Imperial Age

### What do we Stream?

We shall look at the lastest data > trends on what is being streamed as of writing this, but before I do that lets just think about it ideologically:

What in an ideal world would be streamed?

* Knowledge sharing -> Live coaching/learning/teaching
* Games - Shared interactions in a Virtual Game
* Radio -> Stream ->  Music > Art 
* News - Journalism - Democratic live feed 
* PSA - Always Live 
* PSA - Highly data rich Dashboard-y Services
* PSA - Health | eg. **Radio calisthenics**

Now lets look at the data:

Live watching at the moment on Twitch: 3,232,000 = three million two hundred thirty-two thousand.
