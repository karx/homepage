I would start to descirbing and talking about our Streaming age by talking little about how things used to be. 
The advent of Films/Videography is not new, it happened in the 20th century. We had Video tapas, disk recording, and later, streaming media.

This evolution has also brought about a conciderable change in how the Viewing experience has evolved. In this article, I would focus more on these evolutions in the viewers experience and how it affects the ecology.

Theatres. Theaters where the place where one used to go to view a Films/Videos. It was a skillful and heavy job to be able to replay media from a recording. 
Large groups of people gathered to enjoy this playback. Even when TVs came out, families used to gather together to watch Films and TV series to enjoy. Watching a Media stream was a `Communal Experience`.

Then came the smartphones and the tablets, the cheaper PCs, viewing habbits became personal. After the Youtube Boom, the viewing experience became very personal. The viewing sessions were private, even when we share, its for private viewing later. 
The sitting together and watching, felt quite diminished.
