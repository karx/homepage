## What is Rispon?
Virtual Walking Tours and Experiences  

## How do we do?
The Components that make TounTours platform 

- **The Viewer**: Using Aframe/Moz Hubs we create a Virtual scene where agents and visitors can join a running Tour.
- **Agent Dashboard**: To create a tour/scene you need be registered as an **Tour Guide. There are a l**ist of Scenes, available for each tour Guide to host.
Each Tour guide also gets associated with a **Rank.** This rank is used to gate a few options available to this Agent.
- **Viewer Dashboard**: Explore existing/on going tours. Book/enroll on upcoming Tours.
- **Tour**: This a what a single session of Rispon is called. All tour are associated and hosted by one of the Agents**.** A tour invite link + discord membership is used to share Tour with Tourists/Viewers.
A tour after finishing can be found in Agent Dashboard, to recreate again in future.
- **Scenes:** These are basically virtual locations created to be hosted as Tour. We are using Spoke to create them, using Blender to created and export compatible components needed for each Scene.


## Why do we do?
We aim to make people embrace exploring.

This thought is deeply rooted in all of us.
