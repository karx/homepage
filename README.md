## 2v2 WC AoE II: DE
Embracing the Pokemon Generation.   
* What was your first pick ?
* What was your first catch ?
* How long does Metapod sleep ?
* Why does Suduwoodo wiggle ?
* Who date woke up Snorelax ?
* Why is Magikarp frustrated ?
* Does Psyduck give you migrane too ?

These questions are only understoond by the Pokemon Generations, giving them an edge, over the morally overtaken capitalistic society.

Or maybe just that they are *cool* and *fun*.

:sparkles: See what's new in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
