The scope of this project is to design, implement and deliver an end-user consumable product/system for homeSwitches. This would include
 - A interface for the end-user: A mobile App
 - In-wall devices: Arduino based devices
 - Process definations for Installation, mantaince and debugging

The homeSwitch system is proposed to have no dependencies to the internet, and should be a full-funtional system while offline.
