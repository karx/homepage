Jyoti is travelling 30000 kms across the country in a span of 300 days. Jyoti wants to prove that it is possible for a girl to travel 30,000kms alone and also wants to tell the world that hinterland of India is very safe.

While doing this she is helping measure the Happiness Index of india through various parameters. Her cycle has an inbuilt Pollution Monitor which measures the AQI in the entire area that she is cycling in. She is also carrying different devices to measure the number of potholes, conducting survey as well as measure the statistics of each area which contribute to the overall Happiness Index.
