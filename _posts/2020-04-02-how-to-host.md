# How To host your Own Tours

## Getting Started

Before we get into the 3D scenes and the custom assets, the basics are what are most important.

Fill and detail out you agent profile page. Let the tourist know who they are traveling with. Record a custom video/message to tell them more about yourself. Know about the Scene you are hosting a Tour for. 

Let them know about the Tour they are about to join, your past experiences if any, and any tips and tricks for the trade.

## Create a Tour

Using *url* Create your custom tour. Select the scene, start date and time.
You should get a Join Link and a Discord Channel Link

In the ToonTours Discord channel, there would be a text channel as well as a Voice channel created for your Tour. This will provide a great common place to interact with your oncoming tourists. We recommend using this for all important announcements, details and also incase gets their car towed. 

It would be awesome to host a pre-tour getting to know session with your tourist here, hype them up about the oncoming tour, and if you get a chance, call them on "Tutorial Scene" and ease them into the Virtual relm.
